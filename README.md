# Smartphone Class - Python OOP Challenge

This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python through the creation of a `Smartphone` class. It models smartphone objects with attributes like brand, model, and storage capacity, and includes methods to display their information.

## Description

The `Smartphone` class encapsulates data related to smartphones, such as brand, model, and storage size. The class initializer (`__init__`) sets these attributes for each instance, and a method named `display_info` returns a formatted string summarizing the phone's details. The project creates multiple smartphone objects and prints their descriptions.

## Key Features

- Creation of a Python class with an initializer to set instance attributes  
- Definition of instance methods to interact with object data  
- Instantiation of multiple objects with unique attribute values  
- Formatted string output using instance data

## Skills Used

- Object-Oriented Programming concepts:  
  - Class definition  
  - Use of `__init__` initializer  
  - Instance methods  
  - Object instantiation and attribute management  
- Python method and string formatting syntax
